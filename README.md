# brew_map

this is a project which requests data about USA breweries from the OpenBreweryDB API (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) and then presents the returned data on a Leaflet map. It is possible to search the breweries by state, which will return a new and more detailed map of the state's breweries.

The code used to make several requests to the OpenBreweries API at once. This is necessary because the API will only return up to 50 results per request.
